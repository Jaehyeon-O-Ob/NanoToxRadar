# NanoToxRadar
## Introduction
NanoToxRadar is a multitarget nano-QSAR model with improved AD using a diverse multi-components nanoparticles (MC-NPs) dataset. This model was used to predict the cytotoxicity of MC-NP across 110 cell types.

Size-dependent electron-configuration fingerprint (SDEC FP) was employed to represent the structures of the MC-NPs[1], and one-hot encoded cell types were used to predict toxicities toward 110 cell lines. The CatBoost regression model achieved good performance $(R^{2}_{Test} = 0.877)$ and was deployed web-service. ([Link Text](https:www.kitox.re.kr/nanotoxradar))
